if the program have the following points its called oops based program oropps implimented program
 reausability
 enhancemenet and upgradability scalability
 modularity
 testability
 usability
 redundancy
 protection of data from accidental changes
 maintainability
 robust

understand the main prespective 
oops is used to combine both data and the relevent function into the single unit(entity)


understanding the class

encapsulation :
proving public data and hiding the implementation details

inheritance:
    create the new class with extends the proprtites of  parent 
polymorphism:
    it means that meaning of opertaion depends on the obj being operated on.
class in python:    
    everything in the python is am object 
    class needed to generting multiple obj instance
constructor:
    is execute at the beining on object only once
    it automatically called the when obj is created
    the constructor id defined using __init__
class varibale:
    varibale inside the call and they workrd as global variable for the class function
instance variable:

method:
    setter
    getter
the self argument:
accessing the method using .(dot) opertaion
